# üß™ Quick Security Test

## Test Your Platform After Security Updates

### **Test 1: Verify Unauthenticated Access is Blocked**
```bash
# This should return 401 Unauthorized
curl -X GET https://your-librechat-url.railway.app/api/config
```

**Expected Result**: `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`

### **Test 2: Test Your Website Authentication**
1. **Go to your Henly AI website**
2. **Log in with a test user**
3. **Navigate to the chatbot page**
4. **Verify the iframe loads LibreChat**

**Expected Result**: LibreChat should load with organization-specific content

### **Test 3: Verify Organization Isolation**
1. **Create test data in one organization**
2. **Switch to another organization**
3. **Verify you can't see the other organization's data**

**Expected Result**: Complete data isolation between organizations

## üîç **What to Look For**

### **‚úÖ Good Signs:**
- Unauthenticated requests are blocked
- Authenticated users see only their organization's data

- No cross-organization data access

### **‚ùå Warning Signs:**
- Unauthenticated requests succeed (security issue)
- Users can see other organizations' data (data breach)
- MCP servers work without organization context (security issue)

## üö® **If Something Breaks**

**Solution**: Check that your iframe authentication is passing organization context

**Issue**: MCP servers return errors
**Solution**: Verify organization ID is being passed in headers

**Issue**: Users can't access their data
